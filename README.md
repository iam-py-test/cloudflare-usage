# Cloudflare usage tracker
Track the usage of Cloudflare (and a few other similar services) on the top 1000 most popular domains

This project looks for:
- CloudFlare (of course)
- CloudFront (Amazon)
- Akamai
- BunnyCDN
- DDoSGuard
- MyraCloud (Myra Security)
- Sucuri
- Fastly
- Cachefly
- CDN77
- keycdn
- leaseweb

Not all these CDNs are as bad as CloudFlare.
